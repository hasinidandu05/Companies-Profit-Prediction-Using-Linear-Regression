#  Company Profit Prediction Using Linear Regression

Built a predictive model to estimate company profits based on R&D spend, administrative costs, and marketing expenditure.

##  Problem Statement
 Took data from 1000 companies, the goal is to predict profits using multiple linear regression.

## Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, Numpy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (EDA & Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Model Evaluation)

## Key Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training using Linear Regression
- Evaluation using RÂ² Score and RMSE
- Business insight generation

## Dataset
- Source: Provided in `1000_Companies.csv`
- Features: R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, State

## Future Work
- Compare with Lasso and Ridge Regression
- Deploy with Streamlit for interactive UI
